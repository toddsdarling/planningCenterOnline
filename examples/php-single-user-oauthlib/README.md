# PHP Single User OAuth Library Example

* This example is used to log into the Planning Center Online API using the PHP OAuth Library instead of the OAuth PECL extension (in case you can't get it installed in your environment).

## Setup

* First get your consumer key and secret by emailing [support](support@planningcenteronline.com). 
* Use your consumer key and secret to request and authorize an access token. [Accesstoken.io](http://accesstoken.io) is the easy way to do it.
* Plug your values into `index.php`.
* Run it.
